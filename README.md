This project is for an admin website's dashboard, which includes several features. The website features an interactive sidebar for viewing pages, posts, and an admin account section for logging in, registering a new account, or recovering a forgotten password. The sidebar also has a menu option and can be collapsed using a three-strip button. Additionally, there is a light and dark theme toggle feature, along with options for profile, settings, and logout accessible through the profile picture at the top right. The main content area of the page displays a welcome message, total earnings from the company or its employees, and a company data table. Lastly, the footer section includes contact, about us, terms, and booking features.
